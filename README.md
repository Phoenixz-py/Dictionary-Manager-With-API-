# Disctionary-Manager-With-API-
This is an framework type, My code should scan an array if there's word or not. You can push words, but to make it interesting I added API with express.js so front end can access it.
Its not that hard to get


*Just learn below things

- Express js, send/post/delete/port
- prompt(to take input) and u can pretty much guess how made it possible for res to be a sentence, just add description to new properties 
- basic If & Else Statements which is fundamental
- How to call function
- try and catch statements 

*Common Error
- Express/ prompt not a function, install these libraries. These are npms(node package managers lol)
